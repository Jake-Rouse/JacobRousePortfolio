                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Jacob Rouse, and I am currently a student at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. I received my 
                    bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and am currently completing my 
                    master’s degree in computer science and information systems there as well.
                    I have a passion for teaching and programming and am currently working at UNCW’s University Learning Center as a computer 
                    science tutor, as well as serving as a teaching assistant for several classes. After completing my master’s degree, I hope 
                    to pursue a Ph.D. and eventually teach in higher education.

                    <h3>Purple Team</h3>
                    <p>Worked as part of a team to design and develop an FPS game as part of a game development class at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The game was 
                        made in Unreal Engine 5 and was an educational game that taught players basic cybersecurity concepts through fun
                        and engaging gameplay. As part of the project, I contributed to the planning, prototyping, and general development
                        of the game, which included programming the abilities, UI, and respawn system, and contributing in part to the level
                        design.

                    <p>
                        I worked as part of a team to develop a web application that is meant to act as a personal dashboard.
                        The application allows users to create a task list and view that task list on the dashboard, as well
                        as view the daily weather. This project was created as part of a software engineering class. Part of my role within this project included planning
                        documents such as a System Requirements Specification (SRS) document, developing the website using HTML and CSS,
                        and back-end development using Python.

                    <h3>Battleship</h3>
                    <p>Using Python, I developed a fully functional implementation of the game Battleship inside the terminal.
                        This was a solo project, where I was the sole developer of the game.

                    <p>
                        I am currently researching and developing a doubly linked list that allows for faster
                        random access compared to a traditional doubly linked list. This project is in early
                        development.

                        I am currently working as part of a team to develop a library management web application as part of a software modeling,
                        analysis, and design course at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The web application will allow 
                        librarians to manage library items, library patrons, and item checkouts. This project is being developed using Agile Scrum
                        software development methodology. My contribution to the project includes development of the backend using JavaScript and
                        Python and the database using the SQLAlchemy library.

                    <p>I am currently working on my master’s capstone at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The project involves
                        developing a digital twin of a foosball table within NVIDIA's Isaac Sim, which is used for robotics simulation.
                        This capstone is part of a larger project to develop an AI controller for a robot to play foosball. I am currently
                        in my first semester of the capstone project.
