                    currently working towards my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Masters in Computer Science and Information Systems.
                    I have a passion for teaching and programming, and am currently working for UNCW's University Learning Center as a
                    computer science tutor. After
                    completing my masters degree, I hope to go on to teach in higher education.

                    <h3>Purple Team</h3>
                    <p>Worked as a part of team to design and develope an FPS game as part of a game development class. The game was 
                        made in Unreal Engine 5, and was an educational game that taught players basic cybersecurity concepts through fun
                        and engaging gameplay. As a part of the project I contributed to the planning, prototyping, and general development
                        of the game, which included programming the abilities, UI, and respawn system, and contributing in part to the level
                        design.

                    <h3>Battleship</h3>
                    <p> I am currently working on a functioning game of battleships implemented within Python.
                        The game allows for two players to select where they want to place their ships, guess
                        where the other player's ships are, and sink the other player's ships. The game is currently
                        in the final phase of development.

                    <p>
                        I am currently researching and developing a doubly linked list that allows for faster
                        random access compared to a traditional doubly linked list. This project is in early
                        development.

                        I am working as part of team to develope a web application that is meant to act as a personal dashboard.
                        The application will allow users to create a task list and view that task list on the dashboard, as well
                        as view the daily weather. This project is being created as part of a software engineering class and is 
                        in the middle of development. Part of my role with this project will/has included developing planning
                        documents such as a System Requirements Specification (SRS) document, developing the website using HTML and CSS,
                        and back-end development using Python.
